# hello-world
My first repository
Just figuring this out.  Hopefully it will help with DRUPAL 8.

Update: Ha!  Drupal 8 was a complete diasaster!! Total meltdown
for me! Symphony, Composer, etc. Forget it! And after years of
using Drupal, from 5 on. No, it's Backdrop all the way for me
now!

I just want to build a few sites, but need some flexibility in 
storing fields and data, which I can't get in Wordpress or
other CMS's I've tried. 

See https://classicyacht.org/cya-register for an example of
one of my Backdrop sites.
